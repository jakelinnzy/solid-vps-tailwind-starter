# solid-vps-tailwind-starter

A project template with Solid, vite-plugin-ssr, Tailwind, and Expressjs.

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

### `npm dev` or `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
